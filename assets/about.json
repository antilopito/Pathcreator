            "This Lenkintekij√§ application was created for an assignment on course TIEA207. This application is made by a team of four, where everyone was responsible for different components of the application or different parts of the development process. Please note that this application is only a prototype. This application is still in development, and some features, such as the 'strength training and stretching exercises generation' features, are missing.",
            "The idea of this application is to make it easy for you to create routes for walking and running. You can enter the desired lenght of your route for the application, and the application will calculate routes that best match the desired lenght, and draw them on a map. By using this application for drawing a route for your walking or running exercise, you don't need to estimate distances yourself or worry about where you should go and whether you should turn left or right in a particular intersection. That is all handled and calculated for you by this application!",
            "In addition to generating routes, you can also generate strength training or stretching exercises in the EXERCISES page. NB! The EXERCISES page is still in progress."
